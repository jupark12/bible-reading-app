# Devotional App

An app I created to help me read the Bible and take devotional notes more. Needed a way to help me stay intentional with my reading. Also wanted to see my progress and past reflections

## Features
- Bible Reader: Navigate through books and chapters of the Bible (ASV Translation only for now)
- Verse highlighting: Mark and save your favorite verses for the current day's devotional
- Devotional journal: Write and save daily devotional reflections with TipTap package I added rich text editing
- Devotional History: View past devotionals and favorite verses
- User Profiles: Able to register and login
- Built the backend using FastAPI and Postgres in this other repo here: https://github.com/jupark12/bible-api

## TODOs
- Devotional Streak: keep track of how many days in a row user saved devotional
- Keep track of what percentage the user has read the bible
- Responsive Design make app mobile friendly. Probably just need to make Resizeable Panel components be vertically stacked on mobile
- Ability to update user profile
- Ability to customize dashboard with different color schemes
- Add Pagination to Search results and Devotional history

## Example Video
I have not deployed my app anywhere, so if anyone wants to use this, please serve both this repo and the bible-api repo locally. Also need to set up and change database url for postgres
